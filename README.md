# Emojigram

This is a port of my old Replit Creates project, Emojigram, to Rust. It's a simple game that takes a string and converts it into a series of emojis. The emojis are then displayed on the screen, and the user has to guess what the original string was.

Currently all of the sentences are hardcoded, but I plan to add a feature that will have thousands of sentences generated.
